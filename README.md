# rdoom

100% for fun project and to learn Rust to some degree. (Code is not idiomatic and not sure it will ever be).

Code is written as I am thinking it. Not writing tests until maybe I feel it will help me write some portions of the code better. 

# Description

This is not a port of Doom, and not a clone per se, but will be using the shareware Doom WAD to implement my own twist on things. This means nothing definite and nothing is planned, this truly is just coding until something happens to be cohesive and playable.

Some things will be set in stone, like using Rust and Bevy (https://bevyengine.org/) for the rendering and gameplay part and any crates that will help me along the way.


# Random

E1M1 'map view' :)
