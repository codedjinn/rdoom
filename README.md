# rdoom

100% for fun project.

Code is written as I am thinking it. Not writing tests until maybe I feel it will help me write some portions of the code better.

# Description

This is not a port of Doom, and not a clone per se, but will be using the shareware Doom WAD to implement my own twist on things. This means nothing definite and nothing is planned, this truly is just coding until something happens to be cohesive and playable.
