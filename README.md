# rdoom
Pew Pew Pew

Project to fulfill two things, learning Rust and creating a game. 

Yes its another doom 'clone', but chosen because being from the generation
that grew with it and pouring unhealthy amounts of time in it.  Nostalgia and 
then you can grab shareware version of the WAD for free which means it has 
already built maps and assets.
